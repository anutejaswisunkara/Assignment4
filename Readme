I spent almost 24 hours setting up and starting to code. I also have some hands-on practice with Git and coding.

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Based on the effect, i would likely receive a grade around 'A' or 'A-'. It correctly solves the problem.

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
Based on the criteria of functionality, efficiency, code style, best practices, and scalability, i would likely receive a grade around 'A' or 'A-'. It correctly solves the problem.

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
A normal matrix to a sparse matrix and may not compile due to variable-length array usage, which is not standard in C++. 
It lacks input validation and efficient memory use. The approach of scanning the matrix twice could be optimized. The main struggle appears to be with efficient 
memory practices and optimizing the conversion process.
